## Contents

Under ``vsites_cl.csv` and ``vsites_br.csv`` are a list of results for systems calculated using virtual sites.
These have been calculated using ``vsites-v3_n2r-vdw-dimers_hmix-only-v2-torsions.offxml`` present in the test data.
The "gromacs_dG" results are solvation free energies calculated by Meghan Osato (Mobley lab) using Gromacs on the same molecule.

## Caveats.

- Please note that only smiles are provided here, SDFs of the systems are not provided at this point.
- The partial charges are directly assigned from the force field.
