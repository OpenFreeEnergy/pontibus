**Changed:**

* In line with Interchange v0.5+, the box is no longer being scaled by 1.1
  when defining the ``number_of_solvent_molecules``. In those cases, the
  resulting box density will be much higher.
  To roughly reproduce previous behavior, we recommend reducing the
  ``target_density`` to 0.715 * unit.grams / unit.mL when
  defining ``number_of_solvent_molecules``.
